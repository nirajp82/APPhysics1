## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Function → Graph → Slope  
- Velocity = Δx⁄Δt  
- Reading x–t graphs  
- Connecting math slope to physical speed  

---

## 📈 Self-Quiz
1. What does the slope of a position-time graph represent?  
2. If slope doubles, what happens to velocity?  
3. Sketch x = 3t + 2 → find velocity.  
4. Define “average rate of change.”  
5. Identify positive vs negative slope on a motion graph.  

✅ Score ≥ 80 % → move to Week 02
